# ExSeqOF3DVisualizer

This code uses OpenFrameworks v0.9.8 to visualize hundreds of different RNA molecules in neurons from an intact mouse hippocampus.

The ExSeq pre-print, Alon et al 2020, is [now available](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.094268v1) !
The ExSeqProcessing library, which is your first step in converting multi-round RNA imaging into 3D-localized RNA molecules, is available [here](https://github.com/dgoodwin208/ExSeqProcessing).

To get running, you must download [OpenFramworks v.0.9.8](https://openframeworks.cc/download/older/) and put the ExSeqViewer2 folder from this repository into the "apps" folder.

[OpenFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc) is a tremendously powerful tool written entirely by a collaborative, open source community. We, the authors of ExSeq, are grateful for this foundation and are happy to demonstrate its use in a scientific context. While it might be confusing at first to get started with OpenFrameworks, it comes packaged with an excellent set of examples that should run right out of the box. Playing with examples is how you learn to use OpenFrameworks!
